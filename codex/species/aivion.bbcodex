Aivions are bird-like decendants of the dominant lizard-like creatures of their homeworld. They tend to be soft and weak compared to the other species in their original genetic family, allowing their bodies to focus on developing strong brains. They are often addorned in different feathered patterns, and hardened scute to protect some of their most important organs, however both of these are seen as byproducts of natural evolution by modern Aivion standards.

Aivions were the dominant species of their homeworld, like humans to earth. They reached far beyond human achievement, heavily exploring the fields of genetics and robotics, taking them to the early space-faring age of their overall technological progress. They created several species to aid their expansion, both into eachother's territories, and into the stars beyond. They created Dones to do the heavy lifting, Guardians to fight, Fluffians to sell brands, and Synths to create subserviance. |[Species-Preview]| While rights movements for these species existed, they were not accepted to be on the level of Aivions by the broad public.

Aivions would stay to their homeworld as they drilled it down for resources, establishing the hold of Aivion goverments. At the same time, a growing sector of private trade and business would appear, dealing in what little land and resources were left to grab. These corporations would eventually look to the many natural moons orbiting the Aivion homeworld for new land to sell goods, buying them en masse from Aivion governments, starting a corporate space race.

The scramble on the surface of the homeworld would lead to the development of destructive industries, and the demolition of several sustaning forces natural to the homeworld. By the time the inhabitants of the Aivion homeworld realized how much trouble they were in, they had already destroyed the natural lands, the stable atmosphere, and almost all means to survive from the natural enviroment. Nations began turning to the private sectors orbiting the homeworld for help, paying a steep price and giving up the stars entirely to corporate interests just to survive a few days longer.

These nations are gone now. The only survivors left on the surface of the homeworld roam in small nomadic groups, living in the underground to avoid the frequent deadly storms. The rest of the Aivions now live amongst the moons surrounding their dead homeworld, working to the bone to feed the corporate bosses that control the land on the moons, creating their own private prisons, militaries, food chains, and energy sources. While many are stuck on these orbitals, hoping to see their homeworld again one day, others will do whatever to takes to go back, even if it means certain death.
