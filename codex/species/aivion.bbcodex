Aivions were the dominant species of their homeworld, like humans to earth. They reached far beyond human achievement, heavily exploring the fields of genetics and robotics, taking them to the early space-faring age of their overall technological progress. They created several species to aid their expansion, both into eachother's territories, and into the stars beyond. They created Dones to do the heavy lifting, Guardians to fight, Fluffians to sell brands, and Synths to create subserviance.

These Aivions would be ruled by nation-states and corporations of the Aivion homeworld, driving profits and conquering the "lessers" of the planet as they would keep drilling the land for resources, and cracking down on the lower classes and species under them. Their hunger would soon have them complete the first step of conqourering the stars
