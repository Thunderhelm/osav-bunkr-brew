Early into their dive into biological engineering and robotics, the Aivion began to use their newfound progress on themselves. Initially, this was an act of "taking the next step" into the future of what life could be, even if crude. These more cybernetic Aivions would combine themselves with rigid machinery, making a crude fusion of metal and flesh, that to many others would seem almost disturbing as they functioned. This did not stop these cyber Aivion from getting noticed however, as their mechanic limbs allowed them to be pushed much physically harder than many of their peers.

Once their traits were realized, their nature would begin to be demanded by nations and corporations alike for manual labor of all types. Slowly, these robotic Aivions would become stuck under the thumb of much more powerful Aivions than them, forming the new species of Drones. Drones are, at their core, crudely robotic Aivions, considered to be another species in order to deny them the ability to be considered part of Aivion society. They became restricted from almost all social settings, and were denied access to educational resources, forming new ideas of them having a brutish nature, without the ability to think on the level of the Aivion species.

Even with the advent of new species born from Aivion intervention, Drones remain as present as ever. While in the modern day they "officially" keep their same position, lower classes of Aivion society have accepted them back as peers, leading to several social, political, and radical movements to have them brought back into the Aivion species, and given the same resources as the rest of the Aivions. While these movements are popular, they have mostly gained traction among Drones and Aivions that work together in the lowest levels of power among the Orbitals, making the fate of Drones uncertain if the status quo remains.
